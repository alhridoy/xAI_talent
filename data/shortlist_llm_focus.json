    "about": "Zilong Wang is a final-year Ph.D. student at UC San Diego, advised by Prof. Jingbo Shang. He specializes in natural language reasoning and multimodal data mining, with expertise in post-training and distilling language models to enhance reasoning and planning capabilities. His work also focuses on evaluating the reliability and robustness of LLMs in safety-critical contexts and integrating multimodal features to address tasks involving tables, images, and web pages. At Google, Zilong developed Speculative RAG, an RAG framework that achieves state-of-the-art performance both in accuracy and efficiency. This method employs a map-reduce framework, where smaller specialist LMs generate draft responses, which are then verified and refined by a larger generalist LM. Zilong also created the Chain-of-Table agent framework for solving tabular understanding tasks. This system allows LLMs to outline their reasoning step-by-step, iteratively updating a table to reflect the reasoning process. By segmenting tables into manageable parts, Chain-of-Table enhances the depth of table analysis. Additionally, Zilong developed an LLM debugging agent (LDB) to improve coding capabilities. The agent leverages runtime execution data to iteratively refine LLM-generated programs, achieving state-of-the-art performance on coding benchmarks such as HumanEval and MBPP. Earlier in his research, Zilong focused on Document AI, proposing LayoutReader, a multimodal model for detecting reading order in visually-rich documents. He has extended this experience to current LLM systems, introducing OfficeBench, a new agent benchmark for office automation tasks. Zilong has completed research internships at Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and Adobe, and his work has been published in top venues such as ICLR, ACL, EMNLP, and KDD.",

    "about": "I am an AI research scientist with over 20 years of cross-disciplinary R&amp;D experience in speech recognition, natural language processing (NLP), and large-scale language models (LLMs). I began my career at Peking University with a degree in Information Science. I then pursued a Master's degree in Computer Science at the University of Southern California (USC), focusing on speech recognition and statistical machine learning. I also worked on early speech modeling projects at SRI International, participating in the development of speech recognition prototypes for human-computer interaction systems. I joined IBM's New York Lab in 2006 and have held positions as a data mining engineer, machine learning engineer, and research engineer, focusing on applying NLP and ML systems to industry-wide scenarios such as intelligent customer service, semantic search, and financial risk management. During this time, I led multiple end-to-end AI projects, becoming proficient in model development and deployment using platforms such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Spark. I also facilitated the patenting and transformation of numerous research findings into enterprise solutions. Since 2021, I have joined Anthropic, where I have been involved in the design of key modules for large-scale language models (the Claude series), focusing on alignment, security, and conversational capabilities, particularly within subsystems such as RLHF, Constitutional AI, and long-context understanding. I built an experimental framework for the RLHF reward model, designed a multi-dimensional user preference scoring system, and assisted enterprise clients (in finance, law, education, and other sectors) with private model deployment and fine-tuning. During this work, I collaborated closely with multiple teams, including product, security, and legal, to ensure model compliance, security, and controllability. I also actively participated in research initiatives on AI ethics and system security, publishing relevant results at top international conferences such as NeurIPS and ICLR, and was invited to present at the Stanford AI Symposium. I believe that AI is not only an engineering challenge but also a social responsibility. The boundaries of technology must be stretched in tandem with human values. I welcome discussions and collaborations with you.",

    "about": "I am a Research Scientist at Google Brain, where I mainly work on problems in deep learning, reinforcement learning, robotics, and probabilistic machine learning. My recent research focuses on sample-efficient RL methods that could scale to solve difficult continuous control problems in the real-world, which have been covered by Google Research Blogpost and MIT Technology Review. I completed PhD in Machine Learning at the University of Cambridge and the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems in T\u00fcbingen, where I was co-supervised by Richard E. Turner, Zoubin Ghahramani, and Bernhard Sch\u00f6lkopf. During my PhD, I also collaborated closely with Sergey Levine at UC Berkeley/Google Brain and Timothy Lillicrap at DeepMind. I hold my B.ASc. in Engineering Science from the University of Toronto, where I did my thesis with Geoffrey Hinton in distributed training of neural networks using evolutionary algorithms. I also had great fun time working with Steve Mann, developing real-time HDR capture for wearable cameras/displays. I interned at Google Brain hosted by Ilya Sutskever and Vincent Vanhoucke. I also volunteered as a Lab Scientist at Creative Destruction Lab, one of the leading tech-startup incubators in Canada. My PhD was funded by Cambridge-T\u00fcbingen PhD Fellowship, NSERC and Google Focused Research Award. I am a Japan-born Chinese Canadian, and I speak, read, and write in three languages. Having lived in Japan, China, Canada, the US, the UK, and Germany, I go under multiple names: Shane Gu, Shixiang Gu, \u987e\u4e16\u7fd4, \u9867\u4e16\u7fd4(\u3050\u3046 \u305b\u3044\u3057\u3087\u3046). My Chinese name means \u201cworld\u201d (\u4e16) and \u201cflying\u201d (\u7fd4), and thus I \u201cflew around the world\u201d.",

Quanta magazine (written by John Pavlus, https://www.quantamagazine.org/been-kim-is-building-a-translator-for-artificial-intelligence-20190110/) is a great description of what I do and why. I believe the language that humans and machines communicate must be human-centered--higher-level, human-friendly concepts--so that it can make sense to everyone , regardless of how much they know about ML. I gave keynote at ICLR 2022, ECML 2020 and at the G20 meeting in Argentina in 2018. One of my work TCAV received UNESCO Netexplo award, was featured at Google I/O 19' and in Brian Christian's book on The Alignment Problem.

    "about": "I have always been fascinated by games. Whether it was programming robots in RoboWars, exploring RPG dungeons or making up my own outdoors. While I often found rules arbitrary and annoying, i realized that games are fun and challenging because of their rules. The simplicity of the rules of a game, speak to me about how well the game is designed. Starting college at 15, i studied Russian (due to my Russian chess trainers) and functional linguistics. Linguistics teaches us about how we think, how language is a tool that we use to communicate and analyze the world around us. But it is also a box, with rules and constraints that forces you to think in certain ways. Just like how traveling opens your eyes to different modes of living, new languages open your mind up to different modes of thinking. And are better or worse at expressing different concepts. The beauty of deep strategic play in chess continues to remind me that optimal solutions are often surprising, subtle and can even appear to be going backward. The value of starting from what is known and working systematically to uncover the truth of the position. How the rules of a game dictate how the game should be played, something that isn't taken into account often enough in our governmental and political spheres. 11 years as a poker professional opened my eyes to the probabilistic nature of the universe. The fallacy of looking back on history at events as if they were certain. The importance of mixed strategies and how the frequency of an action can determine whether or not that action is correct. I've also learned a lot about how to consistently perform well as a competitor. How diet, exercise, meditation and routine can create the foundation for performing at a high level. When to accept that circumstances are not right for excelling. Knowing when to quit is often the more important skill. I went into programming and ML because i fear that humanity is ill suited to being good stewards of this planet and is on the path to self extinction. If we want our civilization to extend for millions of years, we must design systems that take the long tails of the future into account. With machine learning, we finally have the ability to create an intelligence outside of ourselves that can augment our understanding and make up for our blind spots. Fundamentally if truly intelligent systems can be developed on our digital substrate vs our analog brains. It would be a more alien form of intelligence than even octopuses.

My current research interests are in building object-centric generative models from vision, and in solving the associated learning and inference problems. Prior to joining DeepMind, I worked 3.5 years as a Research Scientist then as a Senior Research Scientist at Vicarious (acquired by Alphabet) where I was building an AI layer for robots. My research there was combining probabilistic graphical models with cognitive science to build neuroscience-inspired generative models for vision which generalized from a limited number of training examples. Prior to joining Vicarious, I graduated from MIT Operations Research Center Master of Science, where I was advised by Prof. Rahul Mazumder. My thesis lied at the intersection of Machine Learning, Optimization and Statistics, building new algorithms to compute interpretable estimators, and studying their statistical performance. Before MIT, I earned an MS in Applied Mathematics from Ecole Polytechnique.",

Email me instead. I am not interested in new job opportunities or consultancy requests. My goal is to spend my career working on important problems and helping to make the world a better place. I think the development of human-level AI has the potential to be one of the most important things to happen this century, and the main focus of my research is on ensuring that this is a robustly good thing for the world. Currently, this looks like staring REALLY hard at transformers and trying to figure out how they work. I consider myself part of the Effective Altruism community, and this has been a significant influence on my career decisions. The world is FULL of important problems, and I've only had a chance to explore a small part of this, so if you think your work is helping to make the world a better place, I'd love to hear from you! I blog about these ideas and other things at neelnanda.io",

By infusing the future state with detail and color, I make it easier for leaders to commit and help them inspire stakeholders to get on board. The result is product and service innovation that delights and delivers lasting value. Because the journey together is full of discovery and practical lessons, everyone feels bought in--and glad they joined in. When design, engineering, creativity, and strategy each make a contribution, something wonderful happens.
