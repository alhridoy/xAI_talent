He specializes in natural language reasoning and multimodal data mining, with expertise in post-training and distilling language models to enhance reasoning and planning capabilities. His work also focuses on evaluating the reliability and robustness of LLMs in safety-critical contexts and integrating multimodal features to address tasks involving tables, images, and web pages. At Google, Zilong developed Speculative RAG, an RAG framework that achieves state-of-the-art performance both in accuracy and efficiency. This method employs a map-reduce framework, where smaller specialist LMs generate draft responses, which are then verified and refined by a larger generalist LM. Zilong also created the Chain-of-Table agent framework for solving tabular understanding tasks. This system allows LLMs to outline their reasoning step-by-step, iteratively updating a table to reflect the reasoning process. By segmenting tables into manageable parts, Chain-of-Table enhances the depth of table analysis. Additionally, Zilong developed an LLM debugging agent (LDB) to improve coding capabilities. The agent leverages runtime execution data to iteratively refine LLM-generated programs, achieving state-of-the-art performance on coding benchmarks such as HumanEval and MBPP. Earlier in his research, Zilong focused on Document AI, proposing LayoutReader, a multimodal model for detecting reading order in visually-rich documents. He has extended this experience to current LLM systems, introducing OfficeBench, a new agent benchmark for office automation tasks. Zilong has completed research internships at Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and Adobe, and his work has been published in top venues such as ICLR, ACL, EMNLP, and KDD.",

Earlier in his research, Zilong focused on Document AI, proposing LayoutReader, a multimodal model for detecting reading order in visually-rich documents. He has extended this experience to current LLM systems, introducing OfficeBench, a new agent benchmark for office automation tasks. Zilong has completed research internships at Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and Adobe, and his work has been published in top venues such as ICLR, ACL, EMNLP, and KDD.",
        "summary": "Zilong Wang is a final-year Ph.D. student at UC San Diego, advised by Prof. Jingbo Shang. He specializes in natural language reasoning and multimodal data mining, with expertise in post-training and distilling language models to enhance reasoning and planning capabilities. His work also focuses on evaluating the reliability and robustness of LLMs in safety-critical contexts and integrating multimodal features to address tasks involving tables, images, and web pages. At Google, Zilong developed Speculative RAG, an RAG framework that achieves state-of-the-art performance both in accuracy and efficiency. This method employs a map-reduce framework, where smaller specialist LMs generate draft responses, which are then verified and refined by a larger generalist LM. Zilong also created the Chain-of-Table agent framework for solving tabular understanding tasks. This system allows LLMs to outline their reasoning step-by-step, iteratively updating a table to reflect the reasoning process.

Built and managed a team of research scientists and engineers in Google Brain focused on improving uncertainty and out-of-distribution robustness in deep learning. \u2013 Principal investigator for multiple research projects on uncertainty & robustness in deep learning which were published in NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, AISTATS, JMLR, TMLR, Medical Imaging, etc. \u2013 Led Brain moonshot on \"reliable deep learning\" focused on compute-efficient research solutions for uncertainty (improving single model uncertainty quantification, efficient ensembles). - Developed scalable research solutions for problems faced by product teams such as improving robustness to dataset shift, noisy labels and leveraging uncertainty for adaptive computation (defer to expert model or human, ask for clarifications, etc), active learning & exploration. Our research led to several first-of-its-kind launches in Google products like YouTube Home/WatchNext/Trust&Safety, Assistant, Ads, Maps, etc and is being used across scientific efforts at Google (health, drug discovery, material discovery, etc). Wrote a practical cookbook distilling best practices for product teams with accompanying code libraries and demo colabs. \u2013 Mentored interns, AI residents and junior research scientists and research engineers. - Received \u201cGoogle Research Tech Impact Award\u201d for outstanding contributions to research, product and infrastructure.

My recent research focuses on sample-efficient RL methods that could scale to solve difficult continuous control problems in the real-world, which have been covered by Google Research Blogpost and MIT Technology Review. I completed PhD in Machine Learning at the University of Cambridge and the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems in T\u00fcbingen, where I was co-supervised by Richard E. Turner, Zoubin Ghahramani, and Bernhard Sch\u00f6lkopf. During my PhD, I also collaborated closely with Sergey Levine at UC Berkeley/Google Brain and Timothy Lillicrap at DeepMind. I hold my B.ASc. in Engineering Science from the University of Toronto, where I did my thesis with Geoffrey Hinton in distributed training of neural networks using evolutionary algorithms. I also had great fun time working with Steve Mann, developing real-time HDR capture for wearable cameras/displays. I interned at Google Brain hosted by Ilya Sutskever and Vincent Vanhoucke. I also volunteered as a Lab Scientist at Creative Destruction Lab, one of the leading tech-startup incubators in Canada.

My recent research focuses on sample-efficient RL methods that could scale to solve difficult continuous control problems in the real-world, which have been covered by Google Research Blogpost and MIT Technology Review. I completed PhD in Machine Learning at the University of Cambridge and the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems in T\u00fcbingen, where I was co-supervised by Richard E. Turner, Zoubin Ghahramani, and Bernhard Sch\u00f6lkopf. During my PhD, I also collaborated closely with Sergey Levine at UC Berkeley/Google Brain and Timothy Lillicrap at DeepMind. I hold my B.ASc. in Engineering Science from the University of Toronto, where I did my thesis with Geoffrey Hinton in distributed training of neural networks using evolutionary algorithms. I also had great fun time working with Steve Mann, developing real-time HDR capture for wearable cameras/displays. I interned at Google Brain hosted by Ilya Sutskever and Vincent Vanhoucke. I also volunteered as a Lab Scientist at Creative Destruction Lab, one of the leading tech-startup incubators in Canada. My PhD was funded by Cambridge-T\u00fcbingen PhD Fellowship, NSERC and Google Focused Research Award. Show less",

        "description": "Extraction from raw text to a knowledge base of entities and fine-grained types is often cast as prediction into a flat set of entity and type labels, neglecting the rich hierarchies over types and entities contained in curated ontologies. Previous attempts to incorporate hierarchical structure have yielded little benefit and are restricted to shallow ontologies. This paper presents new methods using real and complex bilinear mappings for integrating hierarchical information, yielding substantial improvement over flat predictions in entity linking and fine-grained entity typing, and achieving new state-of-the-art results for end-to-end models on the benchmark FIGER dataset. We also present two new human-annotated datasets containing wide and deep hierarchies which we will release to the community to encourage further research in this direction: MedMentions, a collection of PubMed abstracts in which 246k mentions have been mapped to the massive UMLS ontology; and Type- Net, which aligns Freebase types with the WordNet hierarchy to obtain nearly 2k entity types. In experiments on all three datasets we show substantial gains from hierarchy-aware training. Show less",

        "description": "Embedding methods which enforce a partial order or lattice structure over the concept space, such as Order Embeddings (OE), are a natural way to model transitive relational data (e.g. entailment graphs). However, OE learns a deterministic knowledge base, limiting expressiveness of queries and the ability to use uncertainty for both prediction and learning (e.g. learning from expectations). Probabilistic extensions of OE have provided the ability to somewhat calibrate these denotational probabilities while retaining the consistency and inductive bias of ordered models, but lack the ability to model the negative correlations found in real-world knowledge. In this work we show that a broad class of models that assign probability measures to OE can never capture negative correlation, which motivates our construction of a novel box lattice and accompanying probability measure to capture anti-correlation and even disjoint concepts, while still providing the benefits of probabilistic modeling, such as the ability to perform rich joint and conditional queries over arbitrary sets of concepts, and both learning from and predicting calibrated uncertainty We show improvements over previous approaches in modeling the Flickr and WordNet entailment graphs, and investigate the power of the model.

Despite the importance of the problem, there is a relative lack of resources in the form of fine-grained, deep type hierarchies aligned to existing knowledge bases. In response, we introduce TypeNet, a dataset of entity types consisting of over 1941 types organized in a hierarchy, obtained by manually annotating a mapping from 1081 Freebase types to WordNet. We also experiment with several models comparable to state-of-the-art systems and explore techniques to incorporate a structure loss on the hierarchy with the standard mention typing loss, as a first step towards future research on this dataset Show less",

        "description": "In textual information extraction and other sequence labeling tasks it is now common to use recurrent neural networks (such as LSTM) to form rich embedded representations of long-term input co-occurrence patterns. Representation of output co-occurrence patterns is typically limited to a hand-designed graphical model, such as a linear-chain CRF representing short-term Markov dependencies among successive labels. This paper presents a method that learns embedded representations of latent output structure in sequence data. Our model takes the form of a finite-state machine with a large number of latent states per label (a latent variable CRF), where the state-transition matrix is factorized---effectively forming an embedded representation of state-transitions capable of enforcing long-term label dependencies, while supporting exact Viterbi inference over output labels. We demonstrate accuracy improvements and interpretable latent structure in a synthetic but complex task based on CoNLL named entity recognition. Show less",

        "description": "This paper analyzes the varied performance of Matrix Factorization (MF) on the related tasks of relation extraction and knowledge-base completion, which have been unified recently into a single framework of knowledge-base inference (KBI). We first propose a new evaluation protocol that makes comparisons between MF and Tensor Factorization (TF) models fair. We find that this results in a steep drop in MF performance. Our analysis attributes this to the high out-of-vocabulary (OOV) rate of entity pairs in test folds of commonly-used datasets. To alleviate this issue, we propose three extensions to MF. Our best model is a TF-augmented MF model. This hybrid model is robust and obtains strong results across various KBI datasets Show less",

        "description": "Numerous models for grounded language understanding have been recently proposed, including (i) generic modules that can be used easily adapted to any given task with little adaptation and (ii) intuitively appealing modular models that require background knowledge to be instantiated. We compare generic and modular models in how much they lend themselves to a particular form of systematic generalization. Using a synthetic VQA test, we evaluate which models are capable of reasoning about all possible object pairs after training on only a small subset of them. Our findings show that the generalization of modular models is much more systematic and that it is highly sensitive to the module layout, i.e. to how exactly the modules are connected. We furthermore investigate if modular models that generalize well could be made more end-to-end by learning their layout and parametrization. We show how end-to-end methods from prior work often learn a wrong layout and a spurious parametrization that do not facilitate systematic generalization. Show less",

          "description": "Extraction from raw text to a knowledge base of entities and fine-grained types is often cast as prediction into a flat set of entity and type labels, neglecting the rich hierarchies over types and entities contained in curated ontologies. Previous attempts to incorporate hierarchical structure have yielded little benefit and are restricted to shallow ontologies. This paper presents new methods using real and complex bilinear mappings for integrating hierarchical information, yielding substantial improvement over flat predictions in entity linking and fine-grained entity typing, and achieving new state-of-the-art results for end-to-end models on the benchmark FIGER dataset. We also present two new human-annotated datasets containing wide and deep hierarchies which we will release to the community to encourage further research in this direction: MedMentions, a collection of PubMed abstracts in which 246k mentions have been mapped to the massive UMLS ontology; and Type- Net, which aligns Freebase types with the WordNet hierarchy to obtain nearly 2k entity types. In experiments on all three datasets we show substantial gains from hierarchy-aware training. Show less",

          "description": "Embedding methods which enforce a partial order or lattice structure over the concept space, such as Order Embeddings (OE), are a natural way to model transitive relational data (e.g. entailment graphs). However, OE learns a deterministic knowledge base, limiting expressiveness of queries and the ability to use uncertainty for both prediction and learning (e.g. learning from expectations). Probabilistic extensions of OE have provided the ability to somewhat calibrate these denotational probabilities while retaining the consistency and inductive bias of ordered models, but lack the ability to model the negative correlations found in real-world knowledge. In this work we show that a broad class of models that assign probability measures to OE can never capture negative correlation, which motivates our construction of a novel box lattice and accompanying probability measure to capture anti-correlation and even disjoint concepts, while still providing the benefits of probabilistic modeling, such as the ability to perform rich joint and conditional queries over arbitrary sets of concepts, and both learning from and predicting calibrated uncertainty We show improvements over previous approaches in modeling the Flickr and WordNet entailment graphs, and investigate the power of the model.

Despite the importance of the problem, there is a relative lack of resources in the form of fine-grained, deep type hierarchies aligned to existing knowledge bases. In response, we introduce TypeNet, a dataset of entity types consisting of over 1941 types organized in a hierarchy, obtained by manually annotating a mapping from 1081 Freebase types to WordNet. We also experiment with several models comparable to state-of-the-art systems and explore techniques to incorporate a structure loss on the hierarchy with the standard mention typing loss, as a first step towards future research on this dataset Show less",

          "description": "In textual information extraction and other sequence labeling tasks it is now common to use recurrent neural networks (such as LSTM) to form rich embedded representations of long-term input co-occurrence patterns. Representation of output co-occurrence patterns is typically limited to a hand-designed graphical model, such as a linear-chain CRF representing short-term Markov dependencies among successive labels. This paper presents a method that learns embedded representations of latent output structure in sequence data. Our model takes the form of a finite-state machine with a large number of latent states per label (a latent variable CRF), where the state-transition matrix is factorized---effectively forming an embedded representation of state-transitions capable of enforcing long-term label dependencies, while supporting exact Viterbi inference over output labels. We demonstrate accuracy improvements and interpretable latent structure in a synthetic but complex task based on CoNLL named entity recognition. Show less",

We first propose a new evaluation protocol that makes comparisons between MF and Tensor Factorization (TF) models fair. We find that this results in a steep drop in MF performance. Our analysis attributes this to the high out-of-vocabulary (OOV) rate of entity pairs in test folds of commonly-used datasets. To alleviate this issue, we propose three extensions to MF. Our best model is a TF-augmented MF model. This hybrid model is robust and obtains strong results across various KBI datasets Show less",

          "description": "Numerous models for grounded language understanding have been recently proposed, including (i) generic modules that can be used easily adapted to any given task with little adaptation and (ii) intuitively appealing modular models that require background knowledge to be instantiated. We compare generic and modular models in how much they lend themselves to a particular form of systematic generalization. Using a synthetic VQA test, we evaluate which models are capable of reasoning about all possible object pairs after training on only a small subset of them. Our findings show that the generalization of modular models is much more systematic and that it is highly sensitive to the module layout, i.e. to how exactly the modules are connected. We furthermore investigate if modular models that generalize well could be made more end-to-end by learning their layout and parametrization. We show how end-to-end methods from prior work often learn a wrong layout and a spurious parametrization that do not facilitate systematic generalization. Show less",

To this end, we propose to use minimum s-t graph cuts as a partitioning method which is represented as a linear program. The method is topologically aware since it explicitly encodes neighborhood relationships in the image graph. To solve the graph cuts our solution relies on an efficient, scalable, and differentiable quadratic programming approximation. Optimizations specific to cut problems allow us to solve the quadratic programs and compute their gradients significantly more efficiently compared with the general quadratic programming approach. Our results show that our approach is scalable and outperforms existing methods on object discovery tasks with textured scenes and objects. Show less",

We prove under mild assumptions that this representation is however identifiable in a weakly supervised setting. This involves a dataset with paired samples before and after random, unknown interventions, but no further labels. We then introduce implicit latent causal models, variational autoencoders that represent causal variables and causal structure without having to optimize an explicit discrete graph structure. On simple image data, including a novel dataset of simulated robotic manipulation, we demonstrate that such models can reliably identify the causal structure and disentangle causal variables.

Currently, most works on unsupervised object discovery focus on slot-based approaches, which explicitly separate the latent representations of individual objects. While the result is easily interpretable, it usually requires the design of involved architectures. In contrast to this, we propose a comparatively simple approach \u2013 the Complex AutoEncoder (CAE) \u2013 that creates distributed object-centric representations. Following a coding scheme theorized to underlie object representations in biological neurons, its complex-valued activations represent two messages: their magnitudes express the presence of a feature, while the relative phase differences between neurons express which features should be bound together to create joint object representations. In contrast to previous approaches using complex-valued activations for object discovery, we present a fully unsupervised approach that is trained end-to-end \u2013 resulting in significant improvements in performance and efficiency. Further, we show that the CAE achieves competitive or better unsupervised object discovery performance on simple multi-object datasets compared to a state-of-the-art slot-based approach while being up to 100 times faster to train.

Asano, Taco Cohen, Efstratios Gavves Understanding the latent causal factors of a dynamical system from visual observations is considered a crucial step towards agents reasoning in complex environments. In this paper, we propose CITRIS, a variational autoencoder framework that learns causal representations from temporal sequences of images in which underlying causal factors have possibly been intervened upon. In contrast to the recent literature, CITRIS exploits temporality and observing intervention targets to identify scalar and multidimensional causal factors, such as 3D rotation angles. Furthermore, by introducing a normalizing flow, CITRIS can be easily extended to leverage and disentangle representations obtained by already pretrained autoencoders. Extending previous results on scalar causal factors, we prove identifiability in a more general setting, in which only some components of a causal factor are affected by interventions. In experiments on 3D rendered image sequences, CITRIS outperforms previous methods on recovering the underlying causal variables. Moreover, using pretrained autoencoders, CITRIS can even generalize to unseen instantiations of causal factors, opening future research areas in sim-to-real generalization for causal representation learning.

        "description": "Authors: Phillip Lippe, Taco Cohen, Efstratios Gavves Learning the structure of a causal graphical model using both observational and interventional data is a fundamental problem in many scientific fields. A promising direction is continuous optimization for score-based methods, which efficiently learns the causal graph in a data-driven manner. However, to date, those methods require constrained optimization to enforce acyclicity or lack convergence guarantees. In this paper, we present ENCO, an efficient structure learning method for directed, acyclic causal graph leveraging observational and interventional data. ENCO formulates the graph search as an optimization of independent edge likelihoods, with the edge orientation being modeled as a separate parameter. Consequently, we can provide convergence guarantees of ENCO under mild conditions without constraining the score function with respect to acyclicity. In experiments, we show that ENCO can efficiently recover graphs with hundreds of nodes, an order of magnitude larger than what was previously possible. Show less",

        "description": "Authors: Phillip Lippe, Nithin Holla, Shantanu Chandra, Santhosh Rajamanickam, Georgios Antoniou, Ekaterina Shutova, Helen Yannakoudakis An increasingly common expression of online hate speech is multimodal in nature and comes in the form of memes. Designing systems to automatically detect hateful content is of paramount importance if we are to mitigate its undesirable effects on the society at large. The detection of multimodal hate speech is an intrinsically difficult and open problem: memes convey a message using both images and text and, hence, require multimodal reasoning and joint visual and language understanding. In this work, we seek to advance this line of research and develop a multimodal framework for the detection of hateful memes. We improve the performance of existing multimodal approaches beyond simple fine- tuning and, among others, show the effectiveness of upsampling of contrastive examples to encourage multimodality, and ensemble learning based on cross- validation to improve robustness. We furthermore analyze model misclassifications and discuss a number of hypothesis-driven augmentations and their effects on performance, which we hope shall inform future research in the field. Our best approach comprises an ensemble of UNITER-based [3] models and achieves an AUROC score of 80.53, placing us 4th on Phase 2 of the 2020 Hateful Memes Challenge organized by Facebook.

        "description": "Authors: Phillip Lippe, Pengjie Ren, Hinda Haned, Bart Voorn, Maarten de Rijke Abstract: Existing methods for Dialogue Response Generation (DRG) in Task-oriented Dialogue Systems (TDSs) can be grouped into two categories: template-based and corpus-based. The former prepare a collection of response templates in advance and fill the slots with system actions to produce system responses at runtime. The latter generate system responses token by token by taking system actions into account. While template-based DRG provides high precision and highly predictable responses, they usually lack in terms of generating diverse and natural responses when compared to (neural) corpus-based approaches. Conversely, while corpus-based DRG methods are able to generate natural responses, we cannot guarantee their precision or predictability. Moreover, the diversity of responses produced by today's corpus-based DRG methods is still limited. We propose to combine the merits of template-based and corpus-based DRGs by introducing a prototype-based, paraphrasing neural network, called P2-Net, which aims to enhance quality of the responses in terms of both precision and diversity. Instead of generating a response from scratch, P2-Net generates system responses by paraphrasing template-based responses. To guarantee the precision of responses, P2-Net learns to separate a response into its semantics, context influence, and paraphrasing noise, and to keep the semantics unchanged during paraphrasing. To introduce diversity, P2-Net randomly samples previous conversational utterances as prototypes, from which the model can then extract speaking style information. We conduct extensive experiments on the MultiWOZ dataset with both automatic and human evaluations. The results show that P2-Net achieves a significant improvement in diversity while preserving the semantics of responses. Show less",

        "description": "Authors: Phillip Lippe and Efstratios Gavves Abstract: Despite their popularity, to date, the application of normalizing flows on categorical data stays limited. The current practice of using dequantization to map discrete data to a continuous space is inapplicable as categorical data has no intrinsic order. Instead, categorical data have complex and latent relations that must be inferred, like the synonymy between words. In this paper, we investigate Categorical Normalizing Flows, that is normalizing flows for categorical data. By casting the encoding of categorical data in continuous space as a variational inference problem, we jointly optimize the continuous representation and the model likelihood. To maintain unique decoding, we learn a partitioning of the latent space by factorizing the posterior. Meanwhile, the complex relations between the categorical variables are learned by the ensuing normalizing flow, thus maintaining a close-to exact likelihood estimate and making it possible to scale up to a large number of categories. Based on Categorical Normalizing Flows, we propose GraphCNF a permutation-invariant generative model on graphs, outperforming both one-shot and autoregressive flow-based state-of-the-art on molecule generation.

        "description": "Authors: Phillip Lippe and Stephan Schulz Abstract: Most modern first-order theorem provers rely on methods like Superposition [1] and Resolution [5], where implications of a clause set are computed to eventually generate the empty clause. The chronological order of computing inferences is a key aspect of proof search and is crucial for the system\u2019s performance. It is typically controlled by a clause selection heuristic. For the task of clause selection, we present a novel heuristic based on artificial neural networks. Deep Learning has demonstrated significant success in several domains [3, 4]. In our approach, clauses are first embedded by a vocabulary that is learned during training and shares features among similar symbols. The compression of clauses to a fixed size is implemented by combining the concepts of dilated convolutions [8] and a dense block [2] to ensure a broad context. The features of a clause to be evaluated are combined with features of the negated conjecture and of the original axiom set and are processed by a small classifier network. The training is optimized by extensive negative mining and a novel loss function. The heuristic is integrated and tested in the state of the art theorem prover E [6, 7]. In experiments, the network correctly classifies over 90% of all clauses in the test data set with respect to the question if they are useful for the proof or not. However, despite hardware acceleration, the Deep Learning based evaluation currently is several orders of magnitude slower than conventional heuristics, and hence only one from a sample of 25 new proof problems can be solved with the developed technique, highlighting the challenge for future work.

To this end, we propose to use minimum s-t graph cuts as a partitioning method which is represented as a linear program. The method is topologically aware since it explicitly encodes neighborhood relationships in the image graph. To solve the graph cuts our solution relies on an efficient, scalable, and differentiable quadratic programming approximation. Optimizations specific to cut problems allow us to solve the quadratic programs and compute their gradients significantly more efficiently compared with the general quadratic programming approach. Our results show that our approach is scalable and outperforms existing methods on object discovery tasks with textured scenes and objects. Show less",

We prove under mild assumptions that this representation is however identifiable in a weakly supervised setting. This involves a dataset with paired samples before and after random, unknown interventions, but no further labels. We then introduce implicit latent causal models, variational autoencoders that represent causal variables and causal structure without having to optimize an explicit discrete graph structure. On simple image data, including a novel dataset of simulated robotic manipulation, we demonstrate that such models can reliably identify the causal structure and disentangle causal variables.

Currently, most works on unsupervised object discovery focus on slot-based approaches, which explicitly separate the latent representations of individual objects. While the result is easily interpretable, it usually requires the design of involved architectures. In contrast to this, we propose a comparatively simple approach \u2013 the Complex AutoEncoder (CAE) \u2013 that creates distributed object-centric representations. Following a coding scheme theorized to underlie object representations in biological neurons, its complex-valued activations represent two messages: their magnitudes express the presence of a feature, while the relative phase differences between neurons express which features should be bound together to create joint object representations. In contrast to previous approaches using complex-valued activations for object discovery, we present a fully unsupervised approach that is trained end-to-end \u2013 resulting in significant improvements in performance and efficiency. Further, we show that the CAE achieves competitive or better unsupervised object discovery performance on simple multi-object datasets compared to a state-of-the-art slot-based approach while being up to 100 times faster to train.

Asano, Taco Cohen, Efstratios Gavves Understanding the latent causal factors of a dynamical system from visual observations is considered a crucial step towards agents reasoning in complex environments. In this paper, we propose CITRIS, a variational autoencoder framework that learns causal representations from temporal sequences of images in which underlying causal factors have possibly been intervened upon. In contrast to the recent literature, CITRIS exploits temporality and observing intervention targets to identify scalar and multidimensional causal factors, such as 3D rotation angles. Furthermore, by introducing a normalizing flow, CITRIS can be easily extended to leverage and disentangle representations obtained by already pretrained autoencoders. Extending previous results on scalar causal factors, we prove identifiability in a more general setting, in which only some components of a causal factor are affected by interventions. In experiments on 3D rendered image sequences, CITRIS outperforms previous methods on recovering the underlying causal variables. Moreover, using pretrained autoencoders, CITRIS can even generalize to unseen instantiations of causal factors, opening future research areas in sim-to-real generalization for causal representation learning.

          "description": "Authors: Phillip Lippe, Taco Cohen, Efstratios Gavves Learning the structure of a causal graphical model using both observational and interventional data is a fundamental problem in many scientific fields. A promising direction is continuous optimization for score-based methods, which efficiently learns the causal graph in a data-driven manner. However, to date, those methods require constrained optimization to enforce acyclicity or lack convergence guarantees. In this paper, we present ENCO, an efficient structure learning method for directed, acyclic causal graph leveraging observational and interventional data. ENCO formulates the graph search as an optimization of independent edge likelihoods, with the edge orientation being modeled as a separate parameter. Consequently, we can provide convergence guarantees of ENCO under mild conditions without constraining the score function with respect to acyclicity. In experiments, we show that ENCO can efficiently recover graphs with hundreds of nodes, an order of magnitude larger than what was previously possible. Show less",

          "description": "Authors: Phillip Lippe, Nithin Holla, Shantanu Chandra, Santhosh Rajamanickam, Georgios Antoniou, Ekaterina Shutova, Helen Yannakoudakis An increasingly common expression of online hate speech is multimodal in nature and comes in the form of memes. Designing systems to automatically detect hateful content is of paramount importance if we are to mitigate its undesirable effects on the society at large. The detection of multimodal hate speech is an intrinsically difficult and open problem: memes convey a message using both images and text and, hence, require multimodal reasoning and joint visual and language understanding. In this work, we seek to advance this line of research and develop a multimodal framework for the detection of hateful memes. We improve the performance of existing multimodal approaches beyond simple fine- tuning and, among others, show the effectiveness of upsampling of contrastive examples to encourage multimodality, and ensemble learning based on cross- validation to improve robustness. We furthermore analyze model misclassifications and discuss a number of hypothesis-driven augmentations and their effects on performance, which we hope shall inform future research in the field. Our best approach comprises an ensemble of UNITER-based [3] models and achieves an AUROC score of 80.53, placing us 4th on Phase 2 of the 2020 Hateful Memes Challenge organized by Facebook.

          "description": "Authors: Phillip Lippe, Pengjie Ren, Hinda Haned, Bart Voorn, Maarten de Rijke Abstract: Existing methods for Dialogue Response Generation (DRG) in Task-oriented Dialogue Systems (TDSs) can be grouped into two categories: template-based and corpus-based. The former prepare a collection of response templates in advance and fill the slots with system actions to produce system responses at runtime. The latter generate system responses token by token by taking system actions into account. While template-based DRG provides high precision and highly predictable responses, they usually lack in terms of generating diverse and natural responses when compared to (neural) corpus-based approaches. Conversely, while corpus-based DRG methods are able to generate natural responses, we cannot guarantee their precision or predictability. Moreover, the diversity of responses produced by today's corpus-based DRG methods is still limited. We propose to combine the merits of template-based and corpus-based DRGs by introducing a prototype-based, paraphrasing neural network, called P2-Net, which aims to enhance quality of the responses in terms of both precision and diversity. Instead of generating a response from scratch, P2-Net generates system responses by paraphrasing template-based responses. To guarantee the precision of responses, P2-Net learns to separate a response into its semantics, context influence, and paraphrasing noise, and to keep the semantics unchanged during paraphrasing. To introduce diversity, P2-Net randomly samples previous conversational utterances as prototypes, from which the model can then extract speaking style information. We conduct extensive experiments on the MultiWOZ dataset with both automatic and human evaluations. The results show that P2-Net achieves a significant improvement in diversity while preserving the semantics of responses. Show less",

          "description": "Authors: Phillip Lippe and Efstratios Gavves Abstract: Despite their popularity, to date, the application of normalizing flows on categorical data stays limited. The current practice of using dequantization to map discrete data to a continuous space is inapplicable as categorical data has no intrinsic order. Instead, categorical data have complex and latent relations that must be inferred, like the synonymy between words. In this paper, we investigate Categorical Normalizing Flows, that is normalizing flows for categorical data. By casting the encoding of categorical data in continuous space as a variational inference problem, we jointly optimize the continuous representation and the model likelihood. To maintain unique decoding, we learn a partitioning of the latent space by factorizing the posterior. Meanwhile, the complex relations between the categorical variables are learned by the ensuing normalizing flow, thus maintaining a close-to exact likelihood estimate and making it possible to scale up to a large number of categories. Based on Categorical Normalizing Flows, we propose GraphCNF a permutation-invariant generative model on graphs, outperforming both one-shot and autoregressive flow-based state-of-the-art on molecule generation.

          "description": "Authors: Phillip Lippe and Stephan Schulz Abstract: Most modern first-order theorem provers rely on methods like Superposition [1] and Resolution [5], where implications of a clause set are computed to eventually generate the empty clause. The chronological order of computing inferences is a key aspect of proof search and is crucial for the system\u2019s performance. It is typically controlled by a clause selection heuristic. For the task of clause selection, we present a novel heuristic based on artificial neural networks. Deep Learning has demonstrated significant success in several domains [3, 4]. In our approach, clauses are first embedded by a vocabulary that is learned during training and shares features among similar symbols. The compression of clauses to a fixed size is implemented by combining the concepts of dilated convolutions [8] and a dense block [2] to ensure a broad context. The features of a clause to be evaluated are combined with features of the negated conjecture and of the original axiom set and are processed by a small classifier network. The training is optimized by extensive negative mining and a novel loss function. The heuristic is integrated and tested in the state of the art theorem prover E [6, 7]. In experiments, the network correctly classifies over 90% of all clauses in the test data set with respect to the question if they are useful for the proof or not. However, despite hardware acceleration, the Deep Learning based evaluation currently is several orders of magnitude slower than conventional heuristics, and hence only one from a sample of 25 new proof problems can be solved with the developed technique, highlighting the challenge for future work.

          "description": "Deep learning has led to some incredible successes in a very broad range of applications within AI. However, deep learning models remain black boxes, often unable to explain how they reach their final answers with no clear signals as to \u201cwhat went wrong?\u201d when models fail. Further, they typically require huge amounts of data during training and often do not generalize well beyond the data they have been trained on. But AI has not always been this way. In the \u201cGood-Old days\u201d, GOFAI did not require any data at all and the final solutions were interpretable, but the AI\u2019s were not grounded in the real world. Further, unlike deep learning where a single general algorithm could be used to learn to solve many different problems, a single GOFAI algorithm can only be applied to a single task. So can we have our cake and eat it too? Is there a solution to AI out there that requires a limited amount of data, is interpretable, generalises well to new problems and can be applied to a wide variety of tasks? One interesting, developing area of AI that could answer this question is NeuroSymbolic AI which combines deep learning and logical reasoning in a single model. In this tutorial we will explore these models in the context of \u201cstructure\u201d identifying how varying degrees of structure in a model affects its interpretability, how well it generalises to new data as the generality of the algorithm and the variety of tasks it can be applied to.

Video imaging of the flight path is processed to predict the angle and (ideally also) the distance the javelin will travel. This is transmitted by Arduino to control LED which will light up the area where the javelin is set to land.

        "description": "We introduce PaLM 2, a new state-of-the-art language model that has better multilingual and reasoning capabilities and is more compute-efficient than its predecessor PaLM. PaLM 2 is a Transformer-based model trained using a mixture of objectives. Through extensive evaluations on English and multilingual language, and reasoning tasks, we demonstrate that PaLM 2 has significantly improved quality on downstream tasks across different model sizes, while simultaneously exhibiting faster and more efficient inference compared to PaLM. This improved efficiency enables broader deployment while also allowing the model to respond faster, for a more natural pace of interaction. PaLM 2 demonstrates robust reasoning capabilities exemplified by large improvements over PaLM on BIG-Bench and other reasoning tasks. PaLM 2 exhibits stable performance on a suite of responsible AI evaluations, and enables inference-time control over toxicity without additional overhead or impact on other capabilities. Overall, PaLM 2 achieves state-of-the-art performance across a diverse set of tasks and capabilities. When discussing the PaLM 2 family, it is important to distinguish between pre-trained models (of various sizes), fine-tuned variants of these models, and the user-facing products that use these models. In particular, user-facing products typically include additional pre- and post-processing steps. Additionally, the underlying models may evolve over time. Therefore, one should not expect the performance of user-facing products to exactly match the results reported in this report. Show less",

Here, we explore the use of HyperNetworks to generate hyper-prompts: we propose HyperPrompt, a novel architecture for prompt-based task-conditioning of self-attention in Transformers. The hyper-prompts are end-to-end learnable via generation by a HyperNetwork. HyperPrompt allows the network to learn task-specific feature maps where the hyper-prompts serve as task global memories for the queries to attend to, at the same time enabling flexible information sharing among tasks. We show that HyperPrompt is competitive against strong multi-task learning baselines with as few as 0.14% of additional task-conditioning parameters, achieving great parameter and computational efficiency. Through extensive empirical experiments, we demonstrate that HyperPrompt can achieve superior performances over strong T5 multi-task learning baselines and parameter-efficient adapter variants including Prompt-Tuning and HyperFormer++ on Natural Language Understanding benchmarks of GLUE and SuperGLUE across many model sizes.

        "description": "We present LaMDA: Language Models for Dialog Applications. LaMDA is a family of Transformer-based neural language models specialized for dialog, which have up to 137B parameters and are pre-trained on 1.56T words of public dialog data and web text. While model scaling alone can improve quality, it shows less improvements on safety and factual grounding. We demonstrate that fine-tuning with annotated data and enabling the model to consult external knowledge sources can lead to significant improvements towards the two key challenges of safety and factual grounding. The first challenge, safety, involves ensuring that the model's responses are consistent with a set of human values, such as preventing harmful suggestions and unfair bias. We quantify safety using a metric based on an illustrative set of human values, and we find that filtering candidate responses using a LaMDA classifier fine-tuned with a small amount of crowdworker-annotated data offers a promising approach to improving model safety. The second challenge, factual grounding, involves enabling the model to consult external knowledge sources, such as an information retrieval system, a language translator, and a calculator. We quantify factuality using a groundedness metric, and we find that our approach enables the model to generate responses grounded in known sources, rather than responses that merely sound plausible. Finally, we explore the use of LaMDA in the domains of education and content recommendations, and analyze their helpfulness and role consistency. Show less",

        "description": "Region-level demand forecasting is an essential task in ride-hailing services. Accurate ride-hailing demand forecasting can guide vehicle dispatching, improve vehicle utilization, reduce the wait-time, and mitigate traffic congestion. This task is challenging due to the complicated spatiotemporal dependencies among regions. Existing approaches mainly focus on modeling the Euclidean correlations among spatially adjacent regions while we observe that non-Euclidean pair-wise cor-relations among possibly distant regions are also critical for accurate forecasting. In this paper, we propose the spatiotemporal multi-graph convolution network(ST-MGCN), a novel deep learning model for ride-hailing demand forecasting. Wefirst encode the non-Euclidean pair-wise correlations among regions into multiple graphs and then explicitly model these correlations using graph convolution. To utilize the global contextual information in modeling the temporal correlation,we further propose contextual gated recurrent neural network which augments recurrent neural network with a contextual-aware gating mechanism to re-weights different historical observations. We evaluate the proposed model on two real-world large scale ride-hailing demand datasets and observe consistent improvement of more than 10% over state-of-the-art baselines. Show less",

        "title": "Multi-task Representation Learning for Travel Time Estimation",
        "description": "One crucial task in intelligent transportation systems is estimating the duration of a potential trip given the origin location, destination location as well as the departure time. Most existing approaches for travel time estimation assume that the route of the trip is given, which does not hold in real-world applications since the route can be dynamically changed due to traffic conditions, user preferences, etc. As inferring the path from the origin and the destination can be time-consuming and nevertheless error-prone, it is desirable to perform origin-destination travel time estimation, which aims to predict the travel time without online route information. This problem is challenging mainly due to its limited amount of information available and the complicated spatiotemporal dependency. In this paper, we propose a MUlti-task Representation learning model for Arrival Time estimation (MURAT). This model produces meaningful representation that preserves various trip properties in the real-world and at the same time leverages the underlying road network and the spatiotemporal prior knowledge. Furthermore, we propose a multi-task learning framework to utilize the path information of historical trips during the training phase which boosts the performance. Experimental results on two large-scale real-world datasets show that the proposed approach achieves clear improvements over state-of-the-art methods. Show less",

The task is challenging due to (1) complex spatial dependency on road networks, (2) non-linear temporal dynamics with changing road conditions and (3) inherent difficulty of long-term forecasting. To address these challenges, we propose to model the traffic flow as a diffusion process on a directed graph and introduce Diffusion Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (DCRNN), a deep learning framework for traffic forecasting that incorporates both spatial and temporal dependency in the traffic flow. Specifically, DCRNN captures the spatial dependency using bidirectional random walks on the graph, and the temporal dependency using the encoder-decoder architecture with scheduled sampling. We evaluate the framework on two real-world large-scale road network traffic datasets and observe consistent improvement of 12% - 15% over state-of-the-art baselines Show less",

        "description": "Traffic forecasting is a vital part of intelligent transportation systems. However, traffic forecasting is challenging due to short-term (e.g., accidents, constructions) and long-term (e.g., peak-hour, seasonal, weather) impacts. While most previously proposed techniques focus on normal condition forecasting, a single framework for extreme condition traffic forecasting does not exist. In this paper, we propose to take a deep learning approach. We build a deep neural network based on long short term memory (LSTM) units. We apply the deep LSTM to forecast peak-hour traffic and manage to identify unique characteristics of the traffic data. We further improve the architecture for post-accident forecasting and propose the mixture deep LSTM model. Mixture deep LSTM simultaneously models the dynamic behavior of normal condition traffic patterns and automatically learns the representation of accidents. We evaluate our model on a real-world large-scale traffic dataset in Los Angeles to forecast traffic at both peak-hours and post-accidents. When trained end-to-end with suitable regularizations, our approach achieves the state-of-the-art performance, with 30-50% improvement over baselines. We also demonstrate a novel model inspection technique and obtain interesting observations from the trained neural network. Show less",

        "description": "The turn-by-turn directions provided in existing navigation applications are exclusively derived from underlying road network topology information, i.e., the connectivity of edges to each other. Therefore, the turn-by-turn directions are simplified as metric translation of physical world (e.g. distance/time to turn) to spoken language. Such translation - that ignores human cognition of the geographic space - is often verbose and redundant for the drivers who have knowledge about the geographical areas. In this paper, we study a Personalized RoutE Guidance System dubbed PaRE - with which the goal is to generate more customized and intuitive turn-by-turn directions based on user generated content. PaRE utilizes a wealth of user generated historical trajectory data to extract namely \u201clandmarks\u201d (e.g., point of interests or intersections) and frequently visited routes between them from the road network. The extracted information is used to obtain cognitive turn-by-turn directions customized for each user. We formalize this task as a problem of finding the optimal partition for a given route that maximizes the familiarity while minimizes the number of segments in the partition, and propose two efficient algorithms to solve it. For empirical study, we apply our solution to both real and synthetic trajectory datasets to evaluate the performance and effectiveness of PaRE. Show less",

PaLM 2 is a Transformer-based model trained using a mixture of objectives. Through extensive evaluations on English and multilingual language, and reasoning tasks, we demonstrate that PaLM 2 has significantly improved quality on downstream tasks across different model sizes, while simultaneously exhibiting faster and more efficient inference compared to PaLM. This improved efficiency enables broader deployment while also allowing the model to respond faster, for a more natural pace of interaction. PaLM 2 demonstrates robust reasoning capabilities exemplified by large improvements over PaLM on BIG-Bench and other reasoning tasks. PaLM 2 exhibits stable performance on a suite of responsible AI evaluations, and enables inference-time control over toxicity without additional overhead or impact on other capabilities. Overall, PaLM 2 achieves state-of-the-art performance across a diverse set of tasks and capabilities. When discussing the PaLM 2 family, it is important to distinguish between pre-trained models (of various sizes), fine-tuned variants of these models, and the user-facing products that use these models. In particular, user-facing products typically include additional pre- and post-processing steps. Additionally, the underlying models may evolve over time. Therefore, one should not expect the performance of user-facing products to exactly match the results reported in this report. Show less",

HyperPrompt allows the network to learn task-specific feature maps where the hyper-prompts serve as task global memories for the queries to attend to, at the same time enabling flexible information sharing among tasks. We show that HyperPrompt is competitive against strong multi-task learning baselines with as few as 0.14% of additional task-conditioning parameters, achieving great parameter and computational efficiency. Through extensive empirical experiments, we demonstrate that HyperPrompt can achieve superior performances over strong T5 multi-task learning baselines and parameter-efficient adapter variants including Prompt-Tuning and HyperFormer++ on Natural Language Understanding benchmarks of GLUE and SuperGLUE across many model sizes.

LaMDA is a family of Transformer-based neural language models specialized for dialog, which have up to 137B parameters and are pre-trained on 1.56T words of public dialog data and web text. While model scaling alone can improve quality, it shows less improvements on safety and factual grounding. We demonstrate that fine-tuning with annotated data and enabling the model to consult external knowledge sources can lead to significant improvements towards the two key challenges of safety and factual grounding. The first challenge, safety, involves ensuring that the model's responses are consistent with a set of human values, such as preventing harmful suggestions and unfair bias. We quantify safety using a metric based on an illustrative set of human values, and we find that filtering candidate responses using a LaMDA classifier fine-tuned with a small amount of crowdworker-annotated data offers a promising approach to improving model safety. The second challenge, factual grounding, involves enabling the model to consult external knowledge sources, such as an information retrieval system, a language translator, and a calculator. We quantify factuality using a groundedness metric, and we find that our approach enables the model to generate responses grounded in known sources, rather than responses that merely sound plausible. Finally, we explore the use of LaMDA in the domains of education and content recommendations, and analyze their helpfulness and role consistency. Show less",

          "description": "Region-level demand forecasting is an essential task in ride-hailing services. Accurate ride-hailing demand forecasting can guide vehicle dispatching, improve vehicle utilization, reduce the wait-time, and mitigate traffic congestion. This task is challenging due to the complicated spatiotemporal dependencies among regions. Existing approaches mainly focus on modeling the Euclidean correlations among spatially adjacent regions while we observe that non-Euclidean pair-wise cor-relations among possibly distant regions are also critical for accurate forecasting. In this paper, we propose the spatiotemporal multi-graph convolution network(ST-MGCN), a novel deep learning model for ride-hailing demand forecasting. Wefirst encode the non-Euclidean pair-wise correlations among regions into multiple graphs and then explicitly model these correlations using graph convolution. To utilize the global contextual information in modeling the temporal correlation,we further propose contextual gated recurrent neural network which augments recurrent neural network with a contextual-aware gating mechanism to re-weights different historical observations. We evaluate the proposed model on two real-world large scale ride-hailing demand datasets and observe consistent improvement of more than 10% over state-of-the-art baselines. Show less",

          "description": "One crucial task in intelligent transportation systems is estimating the duration of a potential trip given the origin location, destination location as well as the departure time. Most existing approaches for travel time estimation assume that the route of the trip is given, which does not hold in real-world applications since the route can be dynamically changed due to traffic conditions, user preferences, etc. As inferring the path from the origin and the destination can be time-consuming and nevertheless error-prone, it is desirable to perform origin-destination travel time estimation, which aims to predict the travel time without online route information. This problem is challenging mainly due to its limited amount of information available and the complicated spatiotemporal dependency. In this paper, we propose a MUlti-task Representation learning model for Arrival Time estimation (MURAT). This model produces meaningful representation that preserves various trip properties in the real-world and at the same time leverages the underlying road network and the spatiotemporal prior knowledge. Furthermore, we propose a multi-task learning framework to utilize the path information of historical trips during the training phase which boosts the performance. Experimental results on two large-scale real-world datasets show that the proposed approach achieves clear improvements over state-of-the-art methods. Show less",

The task is challenging due to (1) complex spatial dependency on road networks, (2) non-linear temporal dynamics with changing road conditions and (3) inherent difficulty of long-term forecasting. To address these challenges, we propose to model the traffic flow as a diffusion process on a directed graph and introduce Diffusion Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (DCRNN), a deep learning framework for traffic forecasting that incorporates both spatial and temporal dependency in the traffic flow. Specifically, DCRNN captures the spatial dependency using bidirectional random walks on the graph, and the temporal dependency using the encoder-decoder architecture with scheduled sampling. We evaluate the framework on two real-world large-scale road network traffic datasets and observe consistent improvement of 12% - 15% over state-of-the-art baselines Show less",

          "description": "Traffic forecasting is a vital part of intelligent transportation systems. However, traffic forecasting is challenging due to short-term (e.g., accidents, constructions) and long-term (e.g., peak-hour, seasonal, weather) impacts. While most previously proposed techniques focus on normal condition forecasting, a single framework for extreme condition traffic forecasting does not exist. In this paper, we propose to take a deep learning approach. We build a deep neural network based on long short term memory (LSTM) units. We apply the deep LSTM to forecast peak-hour traffic and manage to identify unique characteristics of the traffic data. We further improve the architecture for post-accident forecasting and propose the mixture deep LSTM model. Mixture deep LSTM simultaneously models the dynamic behavior of normal condition traffic patterns and automatically learns the representation of accidents. We evaluate our model on a real-world large-scale traffic dataset in Los Angeles to forecast traffic at both peak-hours and post-accidents. When trained end-to-end with suitable regularizations, our approach achieves the state-of-the-art performance, with 30-50% improvement over baselines. We also demonstrate a novel model inspection technique and obtain interesting observations from the trained neural network. Show less",

          "description": "The turn-by-turn directions provided in existing navigation applications are exclusively derived from underlying road network topology information, i.e., the connectivity of edges to each other. Therefore, the turn-by-turn directions are simplified as metric translation of physical world (e.g. distance/time to turn) to spoken language. Such translation - that ignores human cognition of the geographic space - is often verbose and redundant for the drivers who have knowledge about the geographical areas. In this paper, we study a Personalized RoutE Guidance System dubbed PaRE - with which the goal is to generate more customized and intuitive turn-by-turn directions based on user generated content. PaRE utilizes a wealth of user generated historical trajectory data to extract namely \u201clandmarks\u201d (e.g., point of interests or intersections) and frequently visited routes between them from the road network. The extracted information is used to obtain cognitive turn-by-turn directions customized for each user. We formalize this task as a problem of finding the optimal partition for a given route that maximizes the familiarity while minimizes the number of segments in the partition, and propose two efficient algorithms to solve it. For empirical study, we apply our solution to both real and synthetic trajectory datasets to evaluate the performance and effectiveness of PaRE. Show less",

Gemini 2.5 Pro is our most capable model yet, achieving SoTA performance on frontier coding and reasoning benchmarks. In addition to its incredible coding and reasoning skills, Gemini 2.5 Pro is a thinking model that excels at multimodal understanding and it is now able to process up to 3 hours of video content. Its unique combination of long context, multimodal and reasoning capabilities can be combined to unlock new agentic workflows. Gemini 2.5 Flash provides excellent reasoning abilities at a fraction of the compute and latency requirements and Gemini 2.0 Flash and Flash-Lite provide high performance at low latency and cost. Taken together, the Gemini 2.X model generation spans the full Pareto frontier of model capability vs cost, allowing users to explore the boundaries of what is possible with complex agentic problem solving.

        "description": "In this report, we introduce the Gemini 1.5 family of models, representing the next generation of highly compute-efficient multimodal models capable of recalling and reasoning over fine-grained information from millions of tokens of context, including multiple long documents and hours of video and audio. The family includes two new models: (1) an updated Gemini 1.5 Pro, which exceeds the February version on the great majority of capabilities and benchmarks; (2) Gemini 1.5 Flash, a more lightweight variant designed for efficiency with minimal regression in quality. Gemini 1.5 models achieve near-perfect recall on long-context retrieval tasks across modalities, improve the state-of-the-art in long-document QA, long-video QA and long-context ASR, and match or surpass Gemini 1.0 Ultra's state-of-the-art performance across a broad set of benchmarks. Studying the limits of Gemini 1.5's long-context ability, we find continued improvement in next-token prediction and near-perfect retrieval (&gt;99%) up to at least 10M tokens, a generational leap over existing models such as Claude 3.0 (200k) and GPT-4 Turbo (128k). Finally, we highlight real-world use cases, such as Gemini 1.5 collaborating with professionals on completing their tasks achieving 26 to 75% time savings across 10 different job categories, as well as surprising new capabilities of large language models at the frontier; when given a grammar manual for Kalamang, a language with fewer than 200 speakers worldwide, the model learns to translate English to Kalamang at a similar level to a person who learned from the same content.

The Gemini family consists of Ultra, Pro, and Nano sizes, suitable for applications ranging from complex reasoning tasks to on-device memory-constrained use-cases. Evaluation on a broad range of benchmarks shows that our most-capable Gemini Ultra model advances the state of the art in 30 of 32 of these benchmarks - notably being the first model to achieve human-expert performance on the well-studied exam benchmark MMLU, and improving the state of the art in every one of the 20 multimodal benchmarks we examined. We believe that the new capabilities of the Gemini family in cross-modal reasoning and language understanding will enable a wide variety of use cases. We discuss our approach toward post-training and deploying Gemini models responsibly to users through services including Gemini, Gemini Advanced, Google AI Studio, and Cloud Vertex AI. Show less",

        "description": "Large neural models have brought a new challenge to natural language generation (NLG): It has become imperative to ensure the safety and reliability of the output of models that generate freely. To this end, we present an evaluation framework,\u00a0Attributable to Identified Sources\u00a0(AIS), stipulating that NLG output pertaining to the external world is to be verified against an independent, provided source. We define AIS and a two-stage annotation pipeline for allowing annotators to evaluate model output according to annotation guidelines. We successfully validate this approach on generation datasets spanning three tasks (two conversational QA datasets, a summarization dataset, and a table-to-text dataset). We provide full annotation guidelines in the appendices and publicly release the annotated data at\u00a0https://github.com/google-research-datasets/AIS. Show less",

        "description": "We introduce GEM, a living benchmark for natural language Generation (NLG), its Evaluation, and Metrics. Measuring progress in NLG relies on a constantly evolving ecosystem of automated metrics, datasets, and human evaluation standards. Due to this moving target, new models often still evaluate on divergent anglo-centric corpora with well-established, but flawed, metrics. This disconnect makes it challenging to identify the limitations of current models and opportunities for progress. Addressing this limitation, GEM provides an environment in which models can easily be applied to a wide set of tasks and in which evaluation strategies can be tested. Regular updates to the benchmark will help NLG research become more multilingual and evolve the challenge alongside models. This paper serves as the description of the data for which we are organizing a shared task at our ACL 2021 Workshop and to which we invite the entire NLG community to participate. Show less",

        "description": "The linguistic expression of spatial and temporal relations shows considerable structural parallels (Bach, 1986; Filip, 1999; Langacker, 1987; Talmy, 2000; Verkuyl, 1993). Prefixes with spatial origins mark the perfective aspect in Russian. Prefix za- is one of the most productive aspectual markers. It exhibits high semantic variation in addition to its aspectual contribution. When attached to verbs of motion, za- can express the beginning or the end of an event, as it interacts with lexicalized construal of motion events (determinacy). A number of works have addressed the semantics of za- alone (Janda, 1986; Keller, 1992; Paillard, 1991) or in connection with other prefixes (Flier, 1975; Gallant, 1979; Schooneveld, 1978), but no model has been proposed to account for the BEGIN/ END opposition in za-perfective verbs of motion. In this dissertation I offer an account of the BEGIN/ END opposition in za-perfective verbs of motion. Employing the notions of boundedness, scanning, viewpoint extension, plexity, and reference frames (Langacker, 1987; Levinson, 2003; Talmy, 2000), I develop an integrated account of aspect, determinacy, and za-. I show that construals enforced by aspect and determinacy represent conceptualization strategies embodied in spatial experience. I argue for a strong connection between the semantics of the prefix za- and the preposition za . I expand on the Tyler and Shakhova's (2008) account of za 's polysemy to accommodate for the BEGIN/END pattern of za-. I argue that za- is a spatially motivated construal-structuring modifier of events; its extensions in different reference frames gravitate towards different ways of conceptualizing internal structure of motion events ultimately motivating the BEGIN/ END pattern. I further determine that in determinate verbs, unlike other goal prefixes, za- omnivorously collocates with different types of GOAL prepositional phrases. I confirm this claim in a corpus study of prefix-preposition collocations. Show less",

Gemini 2.5 Pro is our most capable model yet, achieving SoTA performance on frontier coding and reasoning benchmarks. In addition to its incredible coding and reasoning skills, Gemini 2.5 Pro is a thinking model that excels at multimodal understanding and it is now able to process up to 3 hours of video content. Its unique combination of long context, multimodal and reasoning capabilities can be combined to unlock new agentic workflows. Gemini 2.5 Flash provides excellent reasoning abilities at a fraction of the compute and latency requirements and Gemini 2.0 Flash and Flash-Lite provide high performance at low latency and cost. Taken together, the Gemini 2.X model generation spans the full Pareto frontier of model capability vs cost, allowing users to explore the boundaries of what is possible with complex agentic problem solving.

The family includes two new models: (1) an updated Gemini 1.5 Pro, which exceeds the February version on the great majority of capabilities and benchmarks; (2) Gemini 1.5 Flash, a more lightweight variant designed for efficiency with minimal regression in quality. Gemini 1.5 models achieve near-perfect recall on long-context retrieval tasks across modalities, improve the state-of-the-art in long-document QA, long-video QA and long-context ASR, and match or surpass Gemini 1.0 Ultra's state-of-the-art performance across a broad set of benchmarks. Studying the limits of Gemini 1.5's long-context ability, we find continued improvement in next-token prediction and near-perfect retrieval (&gt;99%) up to at least 10M tokens, a generational leap over existing models such as Claude 3.0 (200k) and GPT-4 Turbo (128k). Finally, we highlight real-world use cases, such as Gemini 1.5 collaborating with professionals on completing their tasks achieving 26 to 75% time savings across 10 different job categories, as well as surprising new capabilities of large language models at the frontier; when given a grammar manual for Kalamang, a language with fewer than 200 speakers worldwide, the model learns to translate English to Kalamang at a similar level to a person who learned from the same content.

The Gemini family consists of Ultra, Pro, and Nano sizes, suitable for applications ranging from complex reasoning tasks to on-device memory-constrained use-cases. Evaluation on a broad range of benchmarks shows that our most-capable Gemini Ultra model advances the state of the art in 30 of 32 of these benchmarks - notably being the first model to achieve human-expert performance on the well-studied exam benchmark MMLU, and improving the state of the art in every one of the 20 multimodal benchmarks we examined. We believe that the new capabilities of the Gemini family in cross-modal reasoning and language understanding will enable a wide variety of use cases. We discuss our approach toward post-training and deploying Gemini models responsibly to users through services including Gemini, Gemini Advanced, Google AI Studio, and Cloud Vertex AI. Show less",

          "description": "Large neural models have brought a new challenge to natural language generation (NLG): It has become imperative to ensure the safety and reliability of the output of models that generate freely. To this end, we present an evaluation framework,\u00a0Attributable to Identified Sources\u00a0(AIS), stipulating that NLG output pertaining to the external world is to be verified against an independent, provided source. We define AIS and a two-stage annotation pipeline for allowing annotators to evaluate model output according to annotation guidelines. We successfully validate this approach on generation datasets spanning three tasks (two conversational QA datasets, a summarization dataset, and a table-to-text dataset). We provide full annotation guidelines in the appendices and publicly release the annotated data at\u00a0https://github.com/google-research-datasets/AIS. Show less",

          "description": "We introduce GEM, a living benchmark for natural language Generation (NLG), its Evaluation, and Metrics. Measuring progress in NLG relies on a constantly evolving ecosystem of automated metrics, datasets, and human evaluation standards. Due to this moving target, new models often still evaluate on divergent anglo-centric corpora with well-established, but flawed, metrics. This disconnect makes it challenging to identify the limitations of current models and opportunities for progress. Addressing this limitation, GEM provides an environment in which models can easily be applied to a wide set of tasks and in which evaluation strategies can be tested. Regular updates to the benchmark will help NLG research become more multilingual and evolve the challenge alongside models. This paper serves as the description of the data for which we are organizing a shared task at our ACL 2021 Workshop and to which we invite the entire NLG community to participate. Show less",

          "description": "The linguistic expression of spatial and temporal relations shows considerable structural parallels (Bach, 1986; Filip, 1999; Langacker, 1987; Talmy, 2000; Verkuyl, 1993). Prefixes with spatial origins mark the perfective aspect in Russian. Prefix za- is one of the most productive aspectual markers. It exhibits high semantic variation in addition to its aspectual contribution. When attached to verbs of motion, za- can express the beginning or the end of an event, as it interacts with lexicalized construal of motion events (determinacy). A number of works have addressed the semantics of za- alone (Janda, 1986; Keller, 1992; Paillard, 1991) or in connection with other prefixes (Flier, 1975; Gallant, 1979; Schooneveld, 1978), but no model has been proposed to account for the BEGIN/ END opposition in za-perfective verbs of motion. In this dissertation I offer an account of the BEGIN/ END opposition in za-perfective verbs of motion. Employing the notions of boundedness, scanning, viewpoint extension, plexity, and reference frames (Langacker, 1987; Levinson, 2003; Talmy, 2000), I develop an integrated account of aspect, determinacy, and za-. I show that construals enforced by aspect and determinacy represent conceptualization strategies embodied in spatial experience. I argue for a strong connection between the semantics of the prefix za- and the preposition za . I expand on the Tyler and Shakhova's (2008) account of za 's polysemy to accommodate for the BEGIN/END pattern of za-. I argue that za- is a spatially motivated construal-structuring modifier of events; its extensions in different reference frames gravitate towards different ways of conceptualizing internal structure of motion events ultimately motivating the BEGIN/ END pattern. I further determine that in determinate verbs, unlike other goal prefixes, za- omnivorously collocates with different types of GOAL prepositional phrases. I confirm this claim in a corpus study of prefix-preposition collocations. Show less",

Initiated the LLM reasoning project in Google DeepMind with a goal of solving math problems and other complicated NLP tasks which require multi-step reasoning. Designed the well-known last-letter-concatenation task as a motivating problem, and the prompt with a step-by-step reasoning process to solve it. Set up my team's research agenda and lead cross-team collaboration efforts. Key achievements: \u2014 Chain-of-thought prompting (coined by Dale Schuurmans) \u2014 (Universal) self-consistency \u2014 Least-to-most prompting (decomposing tasks/problems) \u2014 Self-debug \u2014 Chain-of-thought decoding (no prompting!) \u2014 LLMs as optimizers \u2014 Instruction tuning \u2014 Mathematic theory for LLMs Google CEO Sundar Pichai presented our work in Google I/O 2022.

PaLM 2 is a Transformer-based model trained using a mixture of objectives. Through extensive evaluations on English and multilingual language, and reasoning tasks, we demonstrate that PaLM 2 has significantly improved quality on downstream tasks across different model sizes, while simultaneously exhibiting faster and more efficient inference compared to PaLM. This improved efficiency enables broader deployment while also allowing the model to respond faster, for a more natural pace of interaction. PaLM 2 demonstrates robust reasoning capabilities exemplified by large improvements over PaLM on BIG-Bench and other reasoning tasks. PaLM 2 exhibits stable performance on a suite of responsible AI evaluations, and enables inference-time control over toxicity without additional overhead or impact on other capabilities. Overall, PaLM 2 achieves state-of-the-art performance across a diverse set of tasks and capabilities. When discussing the PaLM 2 family, it is important to distinguish between pre-trained models (of various sizes), fine-tuned variants of these models, and the user-facing products that use these models. In particular, user-facing products typically include additional pre- and post-processing steps. Additionally, the underlying models may evolve over time. Therefore, one should not expect the performance of user-facing products to exactly match the results reported in this report. Show less",

        "description": "The One Billion Word Benchmark is a dataset derived from the WMT 2011 News Crawl, commonly used to measure language modeling ability in natural language processing. We train models solely on Common Crawl web scrapes partitioned by year, and demonstrate that they perform worse on this task over time due to distributional shift. Analysis of this corpus reveals that it contains several examples of harmful text, as well as outdated references to current events. We suggest that the temporal nature of news and its distribution shift over time makes it poorly suited for measuring language modeling ability, and discuss potential impact and considerations for researchers building language models and evaluation datasets.

          "description": "We introduce PaLM 2, a new state-of-the-art language model that has better multilingual and reasoning capabilities and is more compute-efficient than its predecessor PaLM. PaLM 2 is a Transformer-based model trained using a mixture of objectives. Through extensive evaluations on English and multilingual language, and reasoning tasks, we demonstrate that PaLM 2 has significantly improved quality on downstream tasks across different model sizes, while simultaneously exhibiting faster and more efficient inference compared to PaLM. This improved efficiency enables broader deployment while also allowing the model to respond faster, for a more natural pace of interaction. PaLM 2 demonstrates robust reasoning capabilities exemplified by large improvements over PaLM on BIG-Bench and other reasoning tasks. PaLM 2 exhibits stable performance on a suite of responsible AI evaluations, and enables inference-time control over toxicity without additional overhead or impact on other capabilities. Overall, PaLM 2 achieves state-of-the-art performance across a diverse set of tasks and capabilities. When discussing the PaLM 2 family, it is important to distinguish between pre-trained models (of various sizes), fine-tuned variants of these models, and the user-facing products that use these models. In particular, user-facing products typically include additional pre- and post-processing steps. Additionally, the underlying models may evolve over time. Therefore, one should not expect the performance of user-facing products to exactly match the results reported in this report. Show less",

We train models solely on Common Crawl web scrapes partitioned by year, and demonstrate that they perform worse on this task over time due to distributional shift. Analysis of this corpus reveals that it contains several examples of harmful text, as well as outdated references to current events. We suggest that the temporal nature of news and its distribution shift over time makes it poorly suited for measuring language modeling ability, and discuss potential impact and considerations for researchers building language models and evaluation datasets.

This start-up worked with many bright engineers, working their day jobs and spending an hour or two in the evenings to discuss the new startup\u2019s product. I invested my own money to start full-time work on the product, but our potential investor declined the opportunity. We started to brainstorm for new product ideas; one of them was \u201cInstant messaging with pictures\u201d. Nobody believed in it at the start, but I implemented a working prototype in two weeks, and our first users loved it! I persuaded the engineering team to join this project. We built an alpha version, which helped to raise seed investments. Our investor stopped funding just before a beta launch (winter 2008-2009 was unusually cold for startups). We released international (moodbox.com) and russian (risovaska.ru) versions of our product, but had no resources to continue its development. Show less",

As the sizes of social, transport and communication networks expand, performing scalable traversal algorithms like SSSP are critical. While there is heightened interest in vertex-centric platforms for scalable graph analysis, there is limited literature on understanding the behavior of distributed algorithms designed using them. Consequently, it is often difficult to offer a tight bound on their algorithm\u2019s complexity. Here, using SSSP as a canonical algorithm on a subgraph-centric abstraction, we perform an algorithmic analysis of its characteristics using meta- graph sketches. We then analyze its empirical performance using real-world graphs to correlate the expected and observed outcomes. Our analysis shows that the runtime behavior of the SSSP algorithm meets the expected behavior, and confirms the bounds on the number of times Dijkstra\u2019s is performed, based on the traversal visit of the meta-graph.

There is an emerging class of inter-connected data which accumulates or varies over time, and on which novel algorithms both over the network structure and across the time-variant attribute values is necessary. We formalize the notion of time-series graphs and propose a Temporally Iterative BSP programming abstraction to develop algorithms on such datasets using several design patterns. Our abstractions leverage a sub-graph centric programming model and extend it to the temporal dimension. We present three time-series graph algorithms based on these design patterns and abstractions, and analyze their performance using the Offish distributed platform on Amazon AWS Cloud. Our results demonstrate the efficacy of the abstractions to develop practical time-series graph algorithms, and scale them on commodity hardware. Show less",

Along with this we have used a concept of watermarking, hash function and a multilayered threshold secret sharing approach to verify the authenticity of each image share before processing instead of decrypting blindly. Moreover this verification scheme allows us to identify dishonest participants who might have gained unauthorized access on secret shares. Consequently, this proposed scheme offers a highly secure mechanism of image secret sharing, which is different from existing traditional methods. Although we have implemented this scheme on images it can easily be used on any digital format as we are dealing with streams of bits Show less",

As the sizes of social, transport and communication networks expand, performing scalable traversal algorithms like SSSP are critical. While there is heightened interest in vertex-centric platforms for scalable graph analysis, there is limited literature on understanding the behavior of distributed algorithms designed using them. Consequently, it is often difficult to offer a tight bound on their algorithm\u2019s complexity. Here, using SSSP as a canonical algorithm on a subgraph-centric abstraction, we perform an algorithmic analysis of its characteristics using meta- graph sketches. We then analyze its empirical performance using real-world graphs to correlate the expected and observed outcomes. Our analysis shows that the runtime behavior of the SSSP algorithm meets the expected behavior, and confirms the bounds on the number of times Dijkstra\u2019s is performed, based on the traversal visit of the meta-graph.

There is an emerging class of inter-connected data which accumulates or varies over time, and on which novel algorithms both over the network structure and across the time-variant attribute values is necessary. We formalize the notion of time-series graphs and propose a Temporally Iterative BSP programming abstraction to develop algorithms on such datasets using several design patterns. Our abstractions leverage a sub-graph centric programming model and extend it to the temporal dimension. We present three time-series graph algorithms based on these design patterns and abstractions, and analyze their performance using the Offish distributed platform on Amazon AWS Cloud. Our results demonstrate the efficacy of the abstractions to develop practical time-series graph algorithms, and scale them on commodity hardware. Show less",

Along with this we have used a concept of watermarking, hash function and a multilayered threshold secret sharing approach to verify the authenticity of each image share before processing instead of decrypting blindly. Moreover this verification scheme allows us to identify dishonest participants who might have gained unauthorized access on secret shares. Consequently, this proposed scheme offers a highly secure mechanism of image secret sharing, which is different from existing traditional methods. Although we have implemented this scheme on images it can easily be used on any digital format as we are dealing with streams of bits Show less",

        "description": "We introduce EmbeddingGemma, a new lightweight, open text embedding model based on the Gemma 3 language model family. Our innovative training recipe strategically captures knowledge from larger models via encoder-decoder initialization and geometric embedding distillation. We improve model robustness and expressiveness with a spread-out regularizer, and ensure generalizability by merging checkpoints from varied, optimized mixtures. Evaluated on the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB) across multilingual, English, and code domains, EmbeddingGemma (300M) achieves state-of-the-art results. Notably, it outperforms prior top models, both proprietary and open, with fewer than 500M parameters, and provides performance comparable to models double its size, offering an exceptional performance-to-cost ratio. Remarkably, this lead persists when quantizing model weights or truncating embedding outputs. This makes EmbeddingGemma particularly well-suited for low-latency and high-throughput use cases such as on-device applications. We provide ablation studies exploring our key design choices. We release EmbeddingGemma to the community to promote further research. Show less",

This paper introduces a novel benchmark to rigorously evaluate image retrieval that demands deep cross-modal contextual understanding. We present two new datasets: the Entity Image Dataset (EI), providing canonical images for Wikipedia entities, and the Mixed-Modal Image Retrieval Dataset (MMIR), derived from the WIT dataset. The MMIR benchmark features two challenging query types requiring models to ground textual descriptions in the context of provided visual entities: single entity-image queries (one entity image with descriptive text) and multi-entity-image queries (multiple entity images with relational text). We empirically validate the benchmark's utility as both a training corpus and an evaluation set for mixed-modal retrieval. The quality of both datasets is further affirmed through crowd-sourced human annotations. Show less",

Capitalizing on Gemini's inherent multilingual and code understanding capabilities, Gemini Embedding produces highly generalizable embeddings for text spanning numerous languages and textual modalities. The representations generated by Gemini Embedding can be precomputed and applied to a variety of downstream tasks including classification, similarity, clustering, ranking, and retrieval. Evaluated on the Massive Multilingual Text Embedding Benchmark (MMTEB), which includes over one hundred tasks across 250+ languages, Gemini Embedding substantially outperforms prior state-of-the-art models, demonstrating considerable improvements in embedding quality. Achieving state-of-the-art performance across MMTEB's multilingual, English, and code benchmarks, our unified model demonstrates strong capabilities across a broad selection of tasks and surpasses specialized domain-specific models.

Thanks to its extensive support for managing hundreds of containers that run cloud-native applications, Kubernetes is the most popular open source container orchestration platform that makes cluster management easy. This workshop adopts a practical approach to get you acquainted with the Kubernetes environment and its applications. Starting with an introduction to the fundamentals of Kubernetes, you'll install and set up your Kubernetes environment. You'll understand how to write YAML files and deploy your first simple web application container using Pod. You'll then assign human-friendly names to Pods, explore various Kubernetes entities and functions, and discover when to use them. As you work through the chapters, this Kubernetes book will show you how you can make full-scale use of Kubernetes by applying a variety of techniques for designing components and deploying clusters. You'll also get to grips with security policies for limiting access to certain functions inside the cluster. Toward the end of the book, you'll get a rundown of Kubernetes advanced features for building your own controller and upgrading to a Kubernetes cluster without downtime. By the end of this workshop, you'll be able to manage containers and run cloud-based applications efficiently using Kubernetes. Show less",

Notably, it outperforms prior top models, both proprietary and open, with fewer than 500M parameters, and provides performance comparable to models double its size, offering an exceptional performance-to-cost ratio. Remarkably, this lead persists when quantizing model weights or truncating embedding outputs. This makes EmbeddingGemma particularly well-suited for low-latency and high-throughput use cases such as on-device applications. We provide ablation studies exploring our key design choices. We release EmbeddingGemma to the community to promote further research. Show less",

          "description": "Despite advances in multimodal learning, challenging benchmarks for mixed-modal image retrieval that combines visual and textual information are lacking. This paper introduces a novel benchmark to rigorously evaluate image retrieval that demands deep cross-modal contextual understanding. We present two new datasets: the Entity Image Dataset (EI), providing canonical images for Wikipedia entities, and the Mixed-Modal Image Retrieval Dataset (MMIR), derived from the WIT dataset. The MMIR benchmark features two challenging query types requiring models to ground textual descriptions in the context of provided visual entities: single entity-image queries (one entity image with descriptive text) and multi-entity-image queries (multiple entity images with relational text). We empirically validate the benchmark's utility as both a training corpus and an evaluation set for mixed-modal retrieval. The quality of both datasets is further affirmed through crowd-sourced human annotations. Show less",

          "description": "In this report, we introduce Gemini Embedding, a state-of-the-art embedding model leveraging the power of Gemini, Google's most capable large language model. Capitalizing on Gemini's inherent multilingual and code understanding capabilities, Gemini Embedding produces highly generalizable embeddings for text spanning numerous languages and textual modalities. The representations generated by Gemini Embedding can be precomputed and applied to a variety of downstream tasks including classification, similarity, clustering, ranking, and retrieval. Evaluated on the Massive Multilingual Text Embedding Benchmark (MMTEB), which includes over one hundred tasks across 250+ languages, Gemini Embedding substantially outperforms prior state-of-the-art models, demonstrating considerable improvements in embedding quality. Achieving state-of-the-art performance across MMTEB's multilingual, English, and code benchmarks, our unified model demonstrates strong capabilities across a broad selection of tasks and surpasses specialized domain-specific models.

Thanks to its extensive support for managing hundreds of containers that run cloud-native applications, Kubernetes is the most popular open source container orchestration platform that makes cluster management easy. This workshop adopts a practical approach to get you acquainted with the Kubernetes environment and its applications. Starting with an introduction to the fundamentals of Kubernetes, you'll install and set up your Kubernetes environment. You'll understand how to write YAML files and deploy your first simple web application container using Pod. You'll then assign human-friendly names to Pods, explore various Kubernetes entities and functions, and discover when to use them. As you work through the chapters, this Kubernetes book will show you how you can make full-scale use of Kubernetes by applying a variety of techniques for designing components and deploying clusters. You'll also get to grips with security policies for limiting access to certain functions inside the cluster. Toward the end of the book, you'll get a rundown of Kubernetes advanced features for building your own controller and upgrading to a Kubernetes cluster without downtime. By the end of this workshop, you'll be able to manage containers and run cloud-based applications efficiently using Kubernetes. Show less",

These are floating\u2010point vectors featuring, among others, the absolute positions of the players and the ball. We developed various training techniques and enhancements that allowed us to reach a high position at the public leaderboard. In particular, we have managed to win against all Google Brain agents. In the process we showed that it is possible to create a competitive agent based on the floating\u2010point representation, beating all agents presented in the GRF paper benchmark in terms of sample efficiency.\u201d Show less",

        "title": "PromptWizard: Task-Aware Agent-driven Prompt Optimization Framework",
        "description": "Output of LLM can be significantly improved by leving prompt engineering. However, manual prompt engineering is labor-intensive and domain-specific, necessitating automated solutions. This paper introduces PromptWizard, a novel framework leveraging LLMs to iteratively synthesize and refine prompts tailored to specific tasks. Unlike existing approaches, PromptWizard optimizes both prompt instructions and in-context examples, maximizing model performance. The framework iteratively refines prompts by mutating instructions and incorporating negative examples to deepen understanding and ensure diversity. It further enhances both instructions and examples with the aid of a critic, synthesizing new instructions and examples enriched with detailed reasoning steps for optimal performance. Show less",

        "description": "Job Shop Scheduling problem has wide range of applications. However it being a NP-Hard optimization problem, always \ufb01nding an optimal solution is not possible in polynomial amount of time. In this paper we propose a heuristic approach to \ufb01nd near optimal solution for Job Shop Scheduling Problem in predetermined amount of time using Cat Swarm Optimization. Novelty in our approach is our non-conventional way of representing position of cat in search space that ensures advantage of spatial locality is taken. Further while exploring the search space using randomization, we never explore an infeasible solution. This reduces search time. Our proposed approach outperforms some of the conventional algorithms and achieves nearly 86% accuracy, while restricting processing time to one second. Show less",

In this paper we propose a heuristic approach to \ufb01nd near optimal solution for Job Shop Scheduling Problem in predetermined amount of time using Cat Swarm Optimization. Novelty in our approach is our non-conventional way of representing position of cat in search space that ensures advantage of spatial locality is taken. Further while exploring the search space using randomization, we never explore an infeasible solution. This reduces search time. Our proposed approach outperforms some of the conventional algorithms and achieves nearly 86% accuracy, while restricting processing time to one second. Show less",

I began my career at Peking University with a degree in Information Science. I then pursued a Master's degree in Computer Science at the University of Southern California (USC), focusing on speech recognition and statistical machine learning. I also worked on early speech modeling projects at SRI International, participating in the development of speech recognition prototypes for human-computer interaction systems. I joined IBM's New York Lab in 2006 and have held positions as a data mining engineer, machine learning engineer, and research engineer, focusing on applying NLP and ML systems to industry-wide scenarios such as intelligent customer service, semantic search, and financial risk management. During this time, I led multiple end-to-end AI projects, becoming proficient in model development and deployment using platforms such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Spark. I also facilitated the patenting and transformation of numerous research findings into enterprise solutions. Since 2021, I have joined Anthropic, where I have been involved in the design of key modules for large-scale language models (the Claude series), focusing on alignment, security, and conversational capabilities, particularly within subsystems such as RLHF, Constitutional AI, and long-context understanding. I built an experimental framework for the RLHF reward model, designed a multi-dimensional user preference scoring system, and assisted enterprise clients (in finance, law, education, and other sectors) with private model deployment and fine-tuning. During this work, I collaborated closely with multiple teams, including product, security, and legal, to ensure model compliance, security, and controllability. I also actively participated in research initiatives on AI ethics and system security, publishing relevant results at top international conferences such as NeurIPS and ICLR, and was invited to present at the Stanford AI Symposium. I believe that AI is not only an engineering challenge but also a social responsibility. The boundaries of technology must be stretched in tandem with human values. I welcome discussions and collaborations with you.",

I built an experimental framework for training the RLHF reward model, designed prompts and a multi-dimensional preference scoring system, and improved the naturalness and stability of the model in real-world conversational tasks. I designed private deployment and fine-tuning solutions for the Claude API for large enterprise clients (including those in finance, law, and education). I assisted the team in developing long-context processing mechanisms, increasing the context length support to over 100,000 tokens. I collaborated with multiple departments, including product, security, and legal, to ensure that model implementation complied with regulatory and ethical requirements. I also mentored several doctoral interns and research engineers, establishing standard research processes and a shared knowledge base.

        "description": "I am an AI research scientist with over 20 years of cross-disciplinary R&amp;D experience in speech recognition, natural language processing (NLP), and large-scale language models (LLMs). I began my career at Peking University with a degree in Information Science. I then pursued a Master's degree in Computer Science at the University of Southern California (USC), focusing on speech recognition and statistical machine learning. I also worked on early speech modeling projects at SRI International, participating in the development of speech recognition prototypes for human-computer interaction systems. I joined IBM's New York Lab in 2006 and have held positions as a data mining engineer, machine learning engineer, and research engineer, focusing on applying NLP and ML systems to industry-wide scenarios such as intelligent customer service, semantic search, and financial risk management. During this time, I led multiple end-to-end AI projects, becoming proficient in model development and deployment using platforms such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Spark. I also facilitated the patenting and transformation of numerous research findings into enterprise solutions. Since 2021, I have joined Anthropic, where I have been involved in the design of key modules for large-scale language models (the Claude series), focusing on alignment, security, and conversational capabilities, particularly within subsystems such as RLHF, Constitutional AI, and long-context understanding. I built an experimental framework for the RLHF reward model, designed a multi-dimensional user preference scoring system, and assisted enterprise clients (in finance, law, education, and other sectors) with private model deployment and fine-tuning. During this work, I collaborated closely with multiple teams, including product, security, and legal, to ensure model compliance, security, and controllability. I also actively participated in research initiatives on AI ethics and system security, publishing relevant results at top international conferences such as NeurIPS and ICLR, and was invited to present at the Stanford AI Symposium. I believe that AI is not only an engineering challenge but also a social responsibility. The boundaries of technology must be stretched in tandem with human values. I welcome discussions and collaborations with you.",
