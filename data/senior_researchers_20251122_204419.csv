Zilong Wang,Research Scientist at Google DeepMind,Google DeepMind,San Francisco Bay Area,https://www.linkedin.com/in/zilong-ryan-wang-742436171,,,,,"Zilong Wang is a final-year Ph.D. student at UC San Diego, advised by Prof. Jingbo Shang. He specializes in natural language reasoning and multimodal data mining, with expertise in post-training and distilling language models to enhance reasoning and planning capabilities. His work also focuses on evaluating the reliability and robustness of LLMs in safety-critical contexts and integrating multimodal features to address tasks involving tables, images, and web pages. At Google, Zilong developed Speculative RAG, an RAG framework that achieves state-of-the-art performance both in accuracy and efficiency. This method employs a map-reduce framework, where smaller specialist LMs generate draft responses, which are then verified and refined by a larger generalist LM. Zilong also created the Chain-of-Table agent framework for solving tabular understanding tasks. This system allows LLMs to outline their reasoning step-by-step, iteratively updating a table to reflect the reasoning process. By segmenting tables into manageable parts, Chain-of-Table enhances the depth of table analysis. Additionally, Zilong developed an LLM debugging agent (LDB) to improve coding capabilities. The agent leverages runtime execution data to iteratively refine LLM-generated programs, achieving state-of-the-art performance on coding benchmarks such as HumanEval and MBPP. Earlier in his research, Zilong focused on Document AI, proposing LayoutReader, a multimodal model for detecting reading order in visually-rich documents. He has extended this experience to current LLM systems, introducing OfficeBench, a new agent benchmark for office automation tasks. Zilong has completed research internships at Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and Adobe, and his work has been published in top venues such as ICLR, ACL, EMNLP, and KDD.",,0,0,Research Scientist at Google DeepMind

I began my career at Peking University with a degree in Information Science. I then pursued a Master's degree in Computer Science at the University of Southern California (USC), focusing on speech recognition and statistical machine learning. I also worked on early speech modeling projects at SRI International, participating in the development of speech recognition prototypes for human-computer interaction systems. I joined IBM's New York Lab in 2006 and have held positions as a data mining engineer, machine learning engineer, and research engineer, focusing on applying NLP and ML systems to industry-wide scenarios such as intelligent customer service, semantic search, and financial risk management. During this time, I led multiple end-to-end AI projects, becoming proficient in model development and deployment using platforms such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Spark. I also facilitated the patenting and transformation of numerous research findings into enterprise solutions. Since 2021, I have joined Anthropic, where I have been involved in the design of key modules for large-scale language models (the Claude series), focusing on alignment, security, and conversational capabilities, particularly within subsystems such as RLHF, Constitutional AI, and long-context understanding. I built an experimental framework for the RLHF reward model, designed a multi-dimensional user preference scoring system, and assisted enterprise clients (in finance, law, education, and other sectors) with private model deployment and fine-tuning. During this work, I collaborated closely with multiple teams, including product, security, and legal, to ensure model compliance, security, and controllability. I also actively participated in research initiatives on AI ethics and system security, publishing relevant results at top international conferences such as NeurIPS and ICLR, and was invited to present at the Stanford AI Symposium. I believe that AI is not only an engineering challenge but also a social responsibility. The boundaries of technology must be stretched in tandem with human values.

Morgan Griffiths,Research Engineer,OpenAI,"Eugene, Oregon, United States",https://www.linkedin.com/in/morgan-griffiths,,,,,"I have always been fascinated by games. Whether it was programming robots in RoboWars, exploring RPG dungeons or making up my own outdoors. While I often found rules arbitrary and annoying, i realized that games are fun and challenging because of their rules. The simplicity of the rules of a game, speak to me about how well the game is designed. Starting college at 15, i studied Russian (due to my Russian chess trainers) and functional linguistics. Linguistics teaches us about how we think, how language is a tool that we use to communicate and analyze the world around us. But it is also a box, with rules and constraints that forces you to think in certain ways. Just like how traveling opens your eyes to different modes of living, new languages open your mind up to different modes of thinking. And are better or worse at expressing different concepts. The beauty of deep strategic play in chess continues to remind me that optimal solutions are often surprising, subtle and can even appear to be going backward. The value of starting from what is known and working systematically to uncover the truth of the position. How the rules of a game dictate how the game should be played, something that isn't taken into account often enough in our governmental and political spheres. 11 years as a poker professional opened my eyes to the probabilistic nature of the universe. The fallacy of looking back on history at events as if they were certain. The importance of mixed strategies and how the frequency of an action can determine whether or not that action is correct. I've also learned a lot about how to consistently perform well as a competitor. How diet, exercise, meditation and routine can create the foundation for performing at a high level. When to accept that circumstances are not right for excelling. Knowing when to quit is often the more important skill. I went into programming and ML because i fear that humanity is ill suited to being good stewards of this planet and is on the path to self extinction. If we want our civilization to extend for millions of years, we must design systems that take the long tails of the future into account. With machine learning, we finally have the ability to create an intelligence outside of ourselves that can augment our understanding and make up for our blind spots. Fundamentally if truly intelligent systems can be developed on our digital substrate vs our analog brains. It would be a more alien form of intelligence than even octopuses.
