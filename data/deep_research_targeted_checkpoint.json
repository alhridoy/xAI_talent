It analyzes reward-model behavior on structured queries, exposing issues in refusals, reasoning, and alignment ([aclanthology.org](https://aclanthology.org/people/khyathi-chandu/#:~:text=model%20training%20and%20understanding%20are,of%20methods%2C%20such%20as%20the)).  \n- **CertainlyUncertain (ArXiv 2024):** Released the CertainlyUncertain benchmark and a confidence-weighted accuracy metric for vision\u2013language tasks. This work classifies epistemic vs. aleatoric uncertainty in VQA by contrasting answerable vs. unanswerable image\u2013question pairs ([huggingface.co](https://huggingface.co/papers/2407.01942#:~:text=A%20taxonomy%20of%20uncertainty%20in,weighted%20accuracy%20metric)).  \n\n## Research Cluster Category  \nMultimodal AI & Vision-Language  \n\n## Notable Publications  \n- *Agent Lumos: Unified and Modular Training for Open-Source Language Agents* (ACL 2024, 3 citations) ([aclanthology.org](https://aclanthology.org/people/khyathi-chandu/#:~:text=Closed,agent%20learning%2C%20we%20collect%20large))  \n- *Certainly Uncertain: A Benchmark and Metric for Multimodal Epistemic and Aleatoric Awareness* (ArXiv 2024, 0 citations) ([huggingface.co](https://huggingface.co/papers/2407.01942#:~:text=A%20taxonomy%20of%20uncertainty%20in,weighted%20accuracy%20metric))  \n- *RewardBench: Evaluating Reward Models for Language Modeling* (NAACL 2025, 0 citations) ([aclanthology.org](https://aclanthology.org/people/khyathi-chandu/#:~:text=model%20training%20and%20understanding%20are,of%20methods%2C%20such%20as%20the))  \n\n## Impact on Target Areas  \nChandu has significantly advanced open research in large-scale multimodal and reasoning models, and in the development of evaluation frameworks for LLMs. Her work on benchmarks like CertainlyUncertain and RewardBench provides new tools to assess model uncertainty and alignment, directly impacting the reliability of vision\u2013language and RLHF systems ([huggingface.co](https://huggingface.co/papers/2407.01942#:~:text=A%20taxonomy%20of%20uncertainty%20in,weighted%20accuracy%20metric)) ([aclanthology.org](https://aclanthology.org/people/khyathi-chandu/#:~:text=model%20training%20and%20understanding%20are,of%20methods%2C%20such%20as%20the)). By releasing open-source models (Voxtral/Magistral) and agent frameworks (Lumos), she has made sophisticated multimodal and reasoning capabilities more accessible, driving progress in LLM robustness and interactive agent design ([khyathiraghavi.github.io](https://khyathiraghavi.github.io/#:~:text=My%20research%20centers%20on%20developing,focus%20on%20two%20key%20directions)) ([aclanthology.org](https://aclanthology.org/people/khyathi-chandu/#:~:text=Closed,agent%20learning%2C%20we%20collect%20large)).",
